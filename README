Guard watches files and runs a command after a file is modified. This allows you to automatically run tests in the background, restart your development server, reload the browser, and more.

Its tedious to run rake command every single time we change file and if we get large code, you have to wait for entire thing to finish even if you just changed one file. 

GUARD automates the running of spec.
Its a generic way to listen to file modification and then perform some kind of action on that.

SimpleCov is a code coverage analysis tool for Ruby 1.9.  

https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov-html
                                                
 .............
: Basic usage :   
 .............

gem 'simplecov', '>= 0.4.0', :require => false, :group => :test

Then, add the following to your test/test_helper.rb (right at the top, line 00) or spec_helper.rb or cucumber env.rb or whatever test framework you prefer, really - just make sure simplecov is loaded and started BEFORE your app code is loaded:

  require 'simplecov'
  SimpleCov.start
                    
 ........
: TO OPEN :    
 ........          
Run the rspec first then a file is created inside 'coverage' folder. To open this file :

 > open coverage/index.html

 Rail_best_Practices  
----------------------

rails_best_practices is a code metric tool to check the quality of rails codes.
I highly recommend you browse the Rails Best Practices website first.
      http://rails-bestpractices.com    

> gem install rails_best_practices 
 
 ........
: TO RUN :
 ........
 > rails_best_practices -f html --with-textmate

This generates the file called 'rails_best_practices_output.html'.   To open this file :
> open rails_best_practices_output.html
